## 📖 Overview

**GitHunter** is a high-performance web application designed to visualize GitHub user profiles and repositories in a sleek, Cyberpunk-inspired interface.

Built with **Vite** and **TypeScript**, this project demonstrates a production-ready approach to consuming third-party APIs. It moves beyond simple data fetching by implementing a structured **Service Layer** architecture, ensuring strict type safety and robust error handling.

The application interacts directly with the **GitHub REST API** to provide real-time data analysis without requiring any backend server.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔍 Instant User Search:** Asynchronous fetching of user profiles with optimized response times.
* **📊 Deep Insights:** Visualizes key metrics like Followers, Following, Public Repos, and Bio.
* **📂 Repository Showcase:** Automatically lists the user's latest repositories along with Star counts and primary languages.
* **⚡ Type Safety:** 100% strict TypeScript implementation with comprehensive Interfaces (No `any` types).
* **🎨 Neon Aesthetic:** A fully responsive Dark Mode UI featuring Glassmorphism and Neon glow effects.
* **🛡️ Error Handling:** Graceful handling of "404 Not Found" states and API rate limits.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** HTML5, TypeScript (Strict Mode)
* **Data Source:** GitHub REST API (Fetch)
* **Styling:** Modern CSS3 (Variables, Grid/Flexbox, Animations)
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Architecture:** Modular (Service-based pattern)
